# map-yaml-to-image
Quick way to convert shuttles in SS14 Monolith YAML maps to sprite image.

By parsing through each of the entities, we map the static elements such as walls, glasses, grilles to colors, which allows a fast update of the shuttle maps to the Guidebook.

Over time, we'll need to add in mappings for any new elements, as unspecified elements will not show up on the pixel grid.
